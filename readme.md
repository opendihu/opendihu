# Overview
OpenDiHu is a software framework to solve 1D, 2D, and 3D multi-physics problems in parallel with the Finite Element Method.
It is used in the domain of skeletal muscle simulations: Electrophysiology, contraction, neuro-chemo-electro-mechanics.
Design goals are usability, performance and extensibility.

The software is developed at [SGS](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/abteilungen/sgs/index.html?__locale=en) and [IANS](https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html).

# Installation
Refer to the documentation for detailed [installation instructions](https://opendihu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html).

However, if you usually skip instructions, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/opendihu/opendihu.git && cd opendihu && make
```
If there are error messages, have a look at the log file `config.log`.
