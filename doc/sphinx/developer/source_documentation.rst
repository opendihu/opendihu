How to build Doxygen documentation
--------------------------------------

Build the source documentation locally:

.. code-block:: bash

  make doc

This calls the configuration file located in `doc/doxygen/Doxyfile`, and it will generate HTML and LaTeX output.
To look into the locally-build documentation you can use e.g., `firefox doc/doxygen/html/index.html`.
