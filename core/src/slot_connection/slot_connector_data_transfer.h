/**
 * The Data classes contain each a vector that stores the solution. Often, the
 * values need to be accessed to continue computation using them, e.g. in
 * operator splittings. Then possibly not all the values need to be accessed but
 * only some of them while the others are only needed for the own computation.
 * An example is a cellml model that contains lots of internal states and only a
 * single state variable is needed in the diffusion equation.
 *
 * Because the data may be stored in different forms, e.g. as raw Vec, as
 * FieldVariable with several components where only one component is the
 * solution variable or as nested vector, the transfer function that transfers
 * the data from one object to another is implemented using partial
 * specializations of this class.
 *
 * The data is also scaled with a prefactor, that can be given. This is needed
 * for the results of the cellml class.
