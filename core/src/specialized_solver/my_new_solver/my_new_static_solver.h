/** This is a template class that developers can copy and adjust to create their
 * own solver. This solver is static, i.e. has no timestepping. For a dynamic
 * solver, refer to the other template, "my_new_timestepping_solver.h". There
 * are also the files "data_management/my_new_static_solver.{h,cpp}" that need
 * to be adjusted. At the end, add an #include to this file in "opendihu.h".
 *
 *  Briefly explain what your solver does in this comment section.
