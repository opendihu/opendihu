/** \brief An efficient solver for the monodomain equation, as used in the
 * fibers_emg example.
 *
 *  This is like a wrapper to an existing solver structure of Strang with Heun
 * (0D problem) and Implicit Euler (1D problem). It solves the same equation as
 * the wrapped solver would, but more efficiently. The possibly distributed
 * fiber data is communicated to one rank and computed there, such that every
 * fiber is always computed on a single rank. After all timesteps are done, the
 * data is communicated back, such that from outside this solver appears equal
 * to the corresponding nested solver structure. Internally, efficient
 * vectorized code is produced using Vc and the CellmlSourceCodeGenerator.
 *
 *  Stimulation of fibers is done using a fiberDistributionFile and a
 * firingTimesFile.
