namespace MappingBetweenMeshes {
/**
 * This class manages data mappings between different meshes, possibly of
 * different dimensionalities, e.g. 1D->3D and inverse. One mapping object
 * handles both directions of the mapping, e.g. 1D->3D and 3D->1D. But the
 * method to call is different, see below.
 *
 * At first, initializeMappingsBetweenMeshes has to be called once. (This is
 * done at initalization of operator splitting.) Here, the lower dimensional
 * mesh has to be the first mesh and the higher dimensional mesh the second
 * mesh. Then, to perform the mapping, start with prepareMapping, then map and
 * then finalizeMapping.
 *
 * A linear mapping of data from source mesh/function space to target
 * mesh/function space is performed. There are the mentioned two different
 * cases, one for mapping from a lower dimension mesh to a higher dimension mesh
 * and one for the opposite direction.
 * The high to low dimension case simply evaluates the low dimension mesh dofs
 * at the locations of the high dimension dofs. This is performed using the
 * normal interpolation defined by the function space, e.g. linear for linear
 * Lagrange elements in the higher dimensional function space. The mapping from
 * a low dimension mesh to a high dimension mesh works as follows: For every dof
 * in the source function space (lower dimension) their contribution to dofs in
 * the target function space (higher dimension) are determined. This is done
 * using the elements of the target function space (higher dimension), the
 * contribution factors are just the linear interpolation factors, i.e. the
 * evaluated basis functions of the higher dimensional function space. The
 * source values multiplied with these contribution factors are summed up at the
 * target dofs. At the end, the values are divided by the summed up contribution
 * factors at the target dofs.
 *
 * There are also two versions, one where a single component out of the source
 * field variable is transferred to the target field variable (e.g. transfer
 * only one state like Vm from Monodomain eq. to EMG solver) and the one where
 * all components are transferred (e.g. 3D geometry field from elasticity solver
 * to fibers).
 *
 *
 * Example in 1D for mapLowToHighDimension (in this case source and target have
 * both the same :
 *
 * meshes:      t0--s0--------t1-----s1-----t2       t=target dof position,
 * s=source dot position, a source mesh with 2 dofs in mapped to a target mesh
 * with 3 dofs src values:       2                 4
 *
 * determine targetFactors (factors of contribution):
 *              0.8*s0------ 0.2*s0 -------- 0.5*s1
 *                          +0.5*s1
 * total:       0.8 --------- 0.7 ----------- 0.5
 *
 * accumulate values:
 *              1.6 --------- 2.4 ----------- 2.0
 *
 * divide by targetFactors:
 *              1.6/0.8 ------ 2.4/0.7 ------ 2.0/0.5
 * result:       2.0 ---------  3.43 --------  4.0
 *
 *
 *
 * Example for mapLowToHighDimension:
 * meshes:      s0--t0--------s1-----t1-----s2       t=target dof position,
 * s=source dot position, a source mesh with 2 dofs in mapped to a target mesh
 * with 3 dofs src values:  2             3.43          4
 *
 * target:        +0.8*s0           0.5*s1
 *                +0.2*s1          +0.5*s2
 * result:        2.286              3.715
 *
 *
 * How to call the mapping methods:
 * Call initializeMappingsBetweenMeshes once for initialization.
 * 1. mapping from lower to higher dimension function space (e.g. 1D->3D):
 *   fieldVariableSource = lower dimension (e.g. 1D)
 *   fieldVariableTarget = higher dimension (e.g. 3D)
 *
 *   prepareMappingLowToHigh(fieldVariableTarget)
 *
 *   mapLowToHighDimension(fieldVariableSource, fieldVariableTarget)   or
 * mapLowToHighDimension(fieldVariableSource, componentNoSource,
 * fieldVariableTarget, componentNoTarget) (can be repeated for multiple lower
 * dimension meshes, that all together should be mapped to the higher dimension
 * space, e.g. multiple 1D fibers to one 3D mesh)
 *
 *   finalizeMappingLowToHigh(fieldVariableTarget)   or
 * finalizeMapping(fieldVariableTarget, componentNoTarget)
 *
 * 2. mapping from higher to lower dimension fucntion space (e.g. 3D->1D)
 *   fieldVariableSource = higher dimension (e.g. 3D)
 *   fieldVariableTarget = lower dimension (e.g. 1D)
 *
 *   mapHighToLowDimension(fieldVariableSource, fieldVariableTarget)
 *
 * Note, how prepareMapping and finalizeMapping are only needed for case 1.
 * Ghosts are handled correctly within prepareMapping and finalizeMapping.
 * The 2. case is completely local and does not set ghost dofs of
 * fieldVariableTarget. If ghost values are needed afterwards, call
 * fieldVariableTarget->startGhostManipulation().
 *
 * There is now also the possiblity to use the simplified methods
 * "prepareMapping", "map" and "finalizeMapping". No initialization is required.
 * Just always call:
 *
 * prepareMapping(fieldVariableSource, fieldVariableTarget)
 * map(fieldVariableSource, componentNoSource, fieldVariableTarget,
 * componentNoTarget)  // set both componentNos to -1 to map all components
 * finalizeMapping(fieldVariableSource, fieldVariableTarget)
 *
